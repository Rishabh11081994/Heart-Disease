# Heart-Disease
In the project heart disease is classified using supervised machine learning algorithms on the data set containin the number of rows 319 K with 18 features. 

Task completed in the project includes
1. Data visualization and finding insights
2. Data statistical analysis using basis stats function, hypothesis tests like chi square and annova tests are performed to find the assocition of the target variable with the independent variable
3. Applied Logistic regression and Guassian naive bayes algorithms
4. Applied random under sampling technique to balance the imbalance data set
5. The XG boost performed well with accuracy of 0.765 and f1 score of 0.764, the logistic regression almost lies there with accuracy of 0.761 

Business insights

1.The age factors effects the heart disease, people with age of above 60 are most likely to get heart related illness

2.The gender male is more vulnerable to heart related illness compare to other

3.Health condition also matter, poor health effects heart disease

4.Diabetic person most likely to get heart disease, however diabetes at border line case or during pregnancy does not effect heart disease severly

5.Previous history of stroke if patient has than heart disease chances are high

6.Race and alcohol effects least or negligible to heart related disease
